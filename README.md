# PushButton
PushButton is an example that allows transactions to be invoked on another instance of the application.

This GitHub project contains all the source code needed to build and
run the application. All that is required to do this is the following:
### Preparation

* Register for a developer account (it's free) at [devs.golgi.io](https://devs.golgi.io)
* Generate a new Application Key on the developer portal
* Download and install the SDK from the developer portal.
* Clone this repository
* Create a file called ```Golgi.DevKey``` containing a single line (the Developer Key you were assigned)
* Create another file called ```Golgi.AppKey``` containing a single line (the Application Key assigned to your new application).


### Build the Android Application
No Android implementation yet.

### Build the iOS Application
